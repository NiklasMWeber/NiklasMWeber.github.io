## Short Bio according to ChatGPT after feeding it my CV

I am Niklas Weber, a passionate mathematician and researcher in quantitative finance, based in Munich, Germany. My academic journey has been centered around understanding complex financial systems and applying machine learning techniques to explore areas like systemic risk and default propagation in networks.

Currently, I am pursuing my doctoral research at the [Workgroup Financial Mathematics](https://www.fm.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) supervised by [Prof. Thilo Meyer-Brandis](https://www.fm.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professors/meyer_brandis/index.html), [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) and [Prof. Lukas Gonon](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.gonon), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). My primary focus is on investigating systemic risk, machine learning and how both disciplines can benefit from or another. Alongside my research, I actively contribute as a teaching assistant for various courses, including linear algebra, optimization, and computational finance.

My educational background includes a Master of Science degree in Quantitative Finance, earned through a double-degree program at Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna. I am proud to have graduated with distinction (110/110 cum laude) and had the opportunity to participate in the enriching Erasmus+ experience. Additionally, I hold another Master's degree in Financial Mathematics from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, where I was involved in the GrEnFIn (Greening Energy Market and Finance) European Erasmus+ Project. My thesis on "Signature Regression and Credit Cycle Forecasting" was well-received.

Before pursuing advanced degrees, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Mathematics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich. During this time, I worked on various projects, including my thesis on "Static Replication of Window Double Barrier Options" using MATLAB.

Outside academics and finance, I am an active member of various student clubs and organizations. I co-founded and currently lead a Quant Finance Interview Preparation Class at the Workgroup Financial Mathematics every semester. As a result of these activities it we manged to found the Munich Branch of the [Beta Sigma Club](https://www.betasigmaclub.com), where we ''create the next generation of Quants
by letting students creatively and critically engage with financial markets.``

Over the course of the last years as a student and researcher in mathematics, quantitative finance and machine learning I stumbled across many interesting topics and decided it might be worth sharing my notes, thoughts, slides or code in case more people are interested. Feel free to contact [me]() if you want to discuss anything and make sure to check out the website of my dear friend and fellow PhD student [Niklas Walter](niklaswalter.github.io) whose website contains more fascinating content.
